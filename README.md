# Reddit User Profile Scripts

This is a set of scripts for manipulating some of Reddit's user profile features. All options are set to False by default and must be replaced by True in order to function. All of these scripts require a reddit app to be set up. Check [here](https://redditclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oauth/) for a step by step guide on how to set one up.

The clear.py script clears a user's saved, hidden, and upvoted posts history. It can also unsubscribe a user account from all the subreddits it is subscribed to.

The copy.py script copies a user's saved and hidden posts from one user profile to another. It also converts upvoted posts on one profile to saved posts on another. This script can also subscribe one user account to all of the subreddits another account is subscribed to.

The delete.py script replaces all of a user's submitted posts and comments with filler text and then deletes them.
